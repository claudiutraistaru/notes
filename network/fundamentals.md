# Network Fundamentals

- [DHCP(Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Host_Configuration_Protocol): A service that assigns IP addresses within a network. DHCP server issues IP leases to devices.
- [NAT(Network address translation)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation): A service that helps routing private network nodes to public network nodes. A device in a private network does not understand public IP by default even when they are physically connected. For example, NAT can associate (internalAddr,internalPort) combo to a (externalAddr,externalPort) combo: in the case of home-network, externalAddr is a single IP the home router possess.
