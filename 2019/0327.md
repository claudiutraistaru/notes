Today I got into Rust's procedural macro. Key points:

- Instead of working on AST token directly from `macro_rule!`, proc macro begins with TokenStream, which is a list of TokenTree.
- Able to use template code directly and parse them into TokenStream.
- Three kinds of proc macro:

  - function-like macros(proc_macro, (TokenStream) -> TokenStream))
  - derive mode macros(proc_macro_derive, (TokenStream) -> TokenStream))
  - attribute macros(proc_macro_attribute, (TokenStream, TokenStream) -> TokenStream))

- Need a tweek in `Cargo.toml`

```toml
[lib]
proc-macro = true
```

- Maybe it can check syntax from other languages in IDE with RLS. For example, `let sql = sql!(SELECT * FROM posts WHERE id=1);`. It would be great it can check sql syntax in IDE, right? But it might be too much work for RLS. I had RLS crushed a few times today because of proc macro

It is quite different with what I thought proc macros were two days ago. It really looks like something fun to play with.

Another thing about Rust, mostly about cargo:
